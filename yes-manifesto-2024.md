# YES Secretary Manifesto

Harry Boyd - hboyd255@gmail.com - 07/04/2024

I'm running for a position on the
[York Engineering Society](https://yusu.org/activities/view/yorkengsoc) as the
sectary for the academic year 2024/2025. Here is my manifesto.

## Manifesto

My main aim is to lower the barrier to the society, and engineering in general.
I know, first hand, how important it is to have access to a supportive community
and I want the engineering society to be that community. I intend to lead us in
this direction by planning more beginner-friendly technical events and more
collaborative social events with other societies to help people make friends and
feel more included.

On top of building a stronger community within the society, it is also important
to me that we help our members get a strong footing, post-graduation. I plan on
implementing this by organizing more talks from industry professionals, geared
more towards post-grad employability, and by organizing more portfolio-worthy
technical events.

Additionally, I have a few organizational changes in mind. I want to revamp the
society's online presence, especially the GitHub, which I would like to see
become a hub for members to collaborate on projects. I will also ensure that our
events are published to a shared calendar, to make it easier for members to see
what's coming up.
